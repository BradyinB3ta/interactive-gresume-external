        <p class="mb-4">Dear Gary,</p>

        <p class="mb-4">I am writing to express my interest in the Global Practice Architect, Workspace, Google Cloud position, as advertised on Google Careers. Drawing on over a decade of experience in Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy and execution across B2B cloud, virtualization, and SaaS environments, with significant specialization in Google Workspace, I am confident that my proven ability to design comprehensive "plays," drive cross-functional alignment, and translate market insights into tangible business outcomes make me an ideal candidate for this pivotal role.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Throughout my tenure at Google, particularly as a Growth Strategy and Programs Lead, I have consistently focused on optimizing GTM motions for the enterprise segment. A key highlight of my experience includes spearheading the "Simple Shift" (fka Project Plankton) Program, a pivotal competitive response that established an enterprise-ready migration and change management service with PSO teams and Partners. This initiative drove enterprise customer wins (4+ high-value strategic deals to date, with a healthy pipeline for H2 2025) by accelerating sales cycles, significantly increasing close rates, and optimizing the total cost of migration for enterprise customers migrating from Microsoft. My role involved leading complex cross-functional alignment across GTM Strategy, Solutions, Sales Enablement, PSO, Customer Success, and Regional teams, establishing a unified Workspace customer journey‚Äîa foundational architectural blueprint‚Äîaligned to the new GCP sales methodology to enable holistic solution selling.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">My expertise extends to driving critical product launches and enabling global sales teams. I co-led the GTM Enablement and Activation workstream for the Duet AI for Google Workspace and Gemini for Workspace product launches (2023-2024). This involved developing essential content, messaging, and comprehensive sales/partner enablement, including delivering over 20+ training sessions to internal sellers and partners (average attendance ranging from ~100 to 200 for field sessions, and ~200 to 500 for partner sessions), leading hands-on training with FSRs for Gemini for Workspace at Accelerate 2024 Sales Kickoff, and owning the New Business track for the Q2 2024 Gemini Workspace Summit. Notably, I also co-presented on the GTM Strategy for Gemini at the Next 2024 Partner Summit, influencing key partner stakeholders and driving adoption of new Workspace solutions. This comprehensive enablement contributed to significant growth in won Annual Contract Value (ACV).</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Furthermore, my experience in defining and executing GTM processes is underscored by my work in identifying critical gaps in pipeline reporting. Subsequently, I designed and implemented a new, cross-functional reporting framework that aligned Field Sales, Growth Strategy COE, Strategy and Operations, Regional sales leaders, Regional program managers, marketing, and demand engine teams on unified metrics, directly impacting pipeline acceleration. I also scoped and designed the 2024 sales play framework with counterparts, providing the foundational structure for the 2025 framework and strategic inputs on seller activation, aiming to pivot to a customer-centric, value-based selling approach inclusive of industry-specific strategies and narratives.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">I am particularly drawn to this role's emphasis on defining and executing GTM strategy with razor-sharp precision, especially in the context of engaging C-level enterprise buyers. My passion lies in being a market challenger, a drive cultivated through experience earned at Veeam Software, during its period of hyper-growth as a unicorn, where we successfully disrupted legacy solutions by championing purpose-built, superior technology that truly met customer needs. I believe Google Workspace's future lies in telling a holistic solution narrative, moving beyond SKU-based selling. While the team has achieved significant milestones, particularly given historical challenges in broader cloud integration and mindshare, I am eager to leverage this strategic inflection point to help complete our pivot towards a truly unified, customer-centric GTM. This commitment is further underscored by my leadership on the 2024 Frontline Work initiative, a critical strategic effort to address significant market challenges and unlock growth in the Frontline Work TAM, demonstrating my capacity to tackle complex, high-impact problems and drive strategic change.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">My history at Google, coupled with a deep understanding of the Google Cloud ecosystem (inclusive of our Google Workspace Partners) and a drive for competitive market breakthroughs, aligns perfectly with the requirements of the Global Practice Architect role. I am eager to bring my strategic vision and execution capabilities to the Global Practice Architect role and begin building the GTM motions that will define and amplify Google Workspace's next phase of market leadership.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in more detail.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Sincerely,<br>
        Allison Brady</p>
